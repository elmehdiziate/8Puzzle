# 8Puzzle

# How to run the code:
- First yiu will need python to run the script
- You need to install the following libraries: tabulate,csv
    - Run the following command: 
        pip install tabulate - pip install csv

## For eight puzzle game:
- You can test the searches for one puzzle: python eightpuzzle.py
- For multiple puzzles you can generate them by running: python generate.py
- To run all the heuristics on the file generated: python automate.py
- to run the uninformed searches: pyhton automnate3.py

## For N*N puzzle game:
- You can test the searches for one puzzle: python NPuzzle.py
- For multiple puzzles you can generate them by running: python generateN.py
- To run all the heuristics on the file generated: python automateN.py
- to run the uninformed searches: pyhton automnateN3.py
